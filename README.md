obsidian vault for Russian vocabulary root learning 

我是一个刚开始学习俄语的中国学生，有英文基础。
As I am new to Russian, all notes will be written in Chinese and English.
I will learn to write Russian notes gradually :)

I want to use this vault to remember the Russian vocabulary by learning their prefix, suffix and word origins.
Obsidian knowledge graph will show the connection of all the language elements.


The vault is organized as follow:

```
/
├── README.md  (this file)
├── Prefix/
│   ├── prefix1
│   └── prefix2
├── Suffix/
│   ├── suffix1
│   └── suffix2
├── SimpleWords/
│   ├── simple1
│   └── simple2
└── ComplexWords/
    ├── word1
    ├── ...
    └── ...
```

Following rules are followed:

1. all words are written in lower case
